  <span className="block mb-4">
    SpotCureX was created from something we all understand — the frustration of breakouts 
    that seem to choose the worst time to show up. Whether it’s a big day or just a regular 
    morning where you want to feel like yourself, a single pimple can throw everything off. 
    We’ve lived through that, and that’s where our story begins.
  </span>

  <span className="block mb-4">
    After years of dealing with stubborn breakouts, trying countless products, and wishing 
    for something simple but truly effective, we started building what would become our 
    first release: the SpotCureX Hydrocolloid Patch infused with Tea Tree. A gentle, clean 
    blend designed to absorb impurities, calm irritation, and protect your skin while it 
    heals — without the harshness or heavy routines.
  </span>

  <span className="block mb-4">
    We focused on what real people actually need: a patch that works overnight, feels 
    comfortable during the day, and fits into everyday life. No unrealistic promises — 
    just a product made to support your skin’s natural healing.
  </span>

  <span className="block mb-4">
    And this is only the beginning. While our Hydrocolloid + Tea Tree patch is our first 
    launch, we’re already working on a full collection inspired by skin needs we’ve seen 
    over and over again. Soon, you’ll see targeted patches featuring ingredients like 
    <strong> Salicylic Acid </strong> for deep exfoliation, 
    <strong> Retinol </strong> for stubborn spots, 
    <strong> Centella Asiatica </strong> for calming sensitive skin,  
    and other gentle-yet-effective blends — all designed to work with your skin, not 
    against it.
  </span>

  <span className="block">
    At SpotCureX, our mission is simple: skincare that’s honest, clean, and thoughtfully 
    made. Products that make breakouts less stressful and help you feel comfortable in 
    your own skin — one patch at a time.
